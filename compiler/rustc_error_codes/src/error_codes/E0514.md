You have attempted to run a command with cached crates from a previous Rust compiler version.

An example error message looks like:
```
error[E0514]: found crate `std` compiled by an incompatible version of rustc
   |
   = help: please recompile that crate using this compiler (rustc 1.56.0-dev)
   = note: the following crate versions were found:
           crate `std` compiled by rustc 1.55.0-dev: /path/to/folder/rust/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-cf9ea4d089d1ec3c.rlib
           crate `std` compiled by rustc 1.55.0-dev: /path/to/folder/rust/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-cf9ea4d089d1ec3c.so
           crate `std` compiled by rustc 1.55.0-dev: /path/to/folder/rust/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd_detect-98237d958438c080.rlib

error: aborting due to previous error
```

You should either: 
- re-run the command you were attempting to run with the version of the compiler your crates were compiled for (in the above case, 1.55.0-dev)
- recompile the crates for the current compiler version (in the above case, 1.56.0-dev)
